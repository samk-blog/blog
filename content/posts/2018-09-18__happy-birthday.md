Hi!

A very very happy birthday to you! :kissing_heart: I know you're an amazing writer and that you love to write. You've been thinking of putting out your thoughts to the world and I think you should. I'm gifting you this blog for this very reason.

I also know that you don't like to write a lot of code. So, though this blog is based on an open source framework catered towards developers, I've set up a much easier way for you to author and maintain your content. Click [here](https://samreenk.com/admin), login using your new github handle, `samk-blog` (I'll tell you the password 😉). Also, I've created a new email id `samk19.blog@gmail.com` which is used in all this process.

Can't wait to see what you do with this. 👻

Lots of ❤️,<br/>
Maaz

PS: Did you notice that smileys render out of the box here? 🌵
