It was in grade eight when I first rhymed lines. Reading them repeatedly made me chuckle in awe. 

It's been more than a decade now, and I still have the same vigor to write. 

I managed to publish some articles at college, edited some, captioned some, juggled some freelance writing with engineering internals on the other  hand. All in all, I never gave this hobby a backseat. 

As predictable as it may sound, the corporate life consumed me in it's whirlpool and here I am - wanting to start this all over again!
